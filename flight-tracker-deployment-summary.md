## 💡 Pro Tips

2. **Stay within limits** - monitor usage weekly
3. **Use all free services** - App Insights, SSL, etc.
4. **Learn the platform** - free year = free education
5. **Plan migration** - decide at month 11 what's next

### Avoid Common Mistakes:
- ❌ Don't exceed 750 hours/month (= don't run 2 instances)
- ❌ Don't select wrong tier (must be t2.micro or B1S)
- ❌ Don't forget to set usage alerts
- ❌ Don't ignore free tier expiration date
